Understand and Explain your model output (4 points)
1) The mean forecasting method is used to serve as a benchmark for the other forecasts and is the least accurate model in this case, with high error measures across the board. 
2) Averages use the average of past observations and sets weights to determine the significance of older values.  This is mainly used for daily, weekly, or short-term forecasts.  This does not take into account seasonality due to its short measurement period
3)  The moving average assigns equal weight to few observations, also does not handle seasonality well
4) The Naive model (rwf) assumes that in each period the variable takes a random step away from its previous value, and the steps are independently and identically distributed in size.  This was the most accurate method, according to my data
4) HW is used for data with trends.  It is called __double exponential smoothing__ since we have to estimate the current level and slope for trend.  Accounts for seasonality with three equations for level, trend, and seasonality.  



Pick an accuracy measure, compare your models, and state the best model based on the accuracy comparison (2 points)

  The accuracy measure I picked here was MAE.  When comparing the forecast methods, I found that the rwf_forecast had the lowest MAE, 2.26.  The method with the highest MAE was the mean forecast, with 20.76 as the mean error.  
Overall, it seems that the random walk forecast has the lowest and, therefore the most accurate forecast.  I will use the Random Walk Forecast because it had the lowest Mean Absolute Error
