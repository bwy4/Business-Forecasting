#the ACF and PACF plots suggest that the autoregressive coefficient is close to 1. This means that the current value of the differenced series is strongly influenced by its previous value.
#The best arima model is shown here at (0,1,2) with drift.  The sigma^2 is 11.64, which is relatively low.  This indicates that there is a lesser degree of unexplained error within this model.
